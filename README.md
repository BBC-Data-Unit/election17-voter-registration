In May 2017 Dan Wainwright [reported on the UK constituencies with the lowest voter registration](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39999279). This is a story with a lot of caveats: non-UK nationals, which are included in population figures, cannot vote, as we explain at various points in the report. Rob McNeil, of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: 

> "It is difficult to get a precise picture of migrant population of a constituency as the data tends to be broken down by local authority area, many of which are divided up when it comes to seats in Parliament."

However, we believed it was important to report the story both to provide a useful starting point for exploring these issues, and explain these important contexts where others might be looking at the same data. 

## Get the data

This data combines the latest Office for National Statistics data for December 2016, showing the number of registered voters per constituency, with the official population estimates.

* Google spreadsheet: [Registered voters vs population by constituency](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_5h-PVKPwvnwRXK9WbfQ3QqiSPXOQhgGguXJ_e5tOb0/edit#gid=0). *Note: Population estimates are for the 17+ age group as of mid-2015, the latest available. 17 year olds included as they would be 18 by the time the 2016 registration figures were compiled. Figures do not take account of residents who are not legally eligible to vote, eg immigrants or prisoners*
